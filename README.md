# Fally - a system using Widefinds UWB positioning as falldetection to drive a Double Robotics D3 robot
In health and homecare, people with cognitive and physical disabilities usally needs extensive supervision. This is where autonomous robots are very attractive as time and the possiblity to always be present is not always possible. If a fall or similar situation should arise and no other person is present except the fallen one, this could be a critical situation. A system that could detect this and similar scenarios is what the project is trying to solve.

The project was given to us in the course 'Project in Computer Science and Engineering, D0020E', Lule√• Univerity of Technology. The task was to navigate a Double 3 Doublerobotics telepressence robot using the UWB-system developed by WideFind.
